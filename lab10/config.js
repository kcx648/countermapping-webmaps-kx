            description: 'In the fall of 2012, New York City was hit with hurricane that left tens of thousands of public housing residents without power for days or even weeks]. New York City Housing Authority public housing developments were affected. 24,000 government-subsidized apartments and 40,000 rent-stabilized apartments were also affected. With rising sea levels from climate change and the promise of more flooding, which areas and who will likely be most affected? How is affordable housing construction responding to this?',

            description: 'But on Oct. 29, 2012, the water turned against Red Hook. The winds of Hurricane Sandy, striking at high tide, created a massive storm surge that pushed hundreds of millions of gallons of water onto and over New York’s shoreline. The resulting flood would cause $19 billion in damage throughout New York City, killing dozens of people, but Red Hook, which is so low-lying that nearly the entire community fell with the city’s mandatory evacuation zone, bore some of the worst of the storm’s wrath.',
